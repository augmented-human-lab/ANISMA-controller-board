# ANISMA Controller Board

The ANISMA Controller Board consists of a simple Arduino Uno. It controls one or more ANISMA Driver Boards. 


# Setup

To setup the ANISMA Controller Board:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Arduino Sketch (/ANISMA-controller-board/ANISMA-controller-board.ino)
3. Connect the Arduino Uno and upload the sketch.
4. Now make sure a ANISMA Driver Board is connected to the Arduino Uno. See [ANISMA Driver Board Repository](https://github.com/augmented-human-lab/ANISMA) for wiring instructions. 
5. Open ANISMA Software, design and animate a device and click on "Replay using Controllerboard" to replay the actuation sequence using your ANISMA device.
